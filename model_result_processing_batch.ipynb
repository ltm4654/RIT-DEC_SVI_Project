These edits must be made \\nin the 'Define Overall Parameters - editing necessary' section. \\nEither way, you must name the merged point dataset 'raw_model_pred' \\nand put it into your geodatabase for the code to work as written. \\nIf importing raw CSVs, you must uncomment the code block titled \\n'Batch import CSVs into gdb' by highlighting the text and pressing \\nctrl+/ (on windows). You must also define the folder of your raw \\nCSVs, and the number of them to import.\\n\\nYou may also change the number of species and thresholds if desired. \\nDeletions from the 'species_list' can be done independently, but \\nadditions require adding additional entries to the 'species_fullnames' \\nlist and 'threshold_dict' dictionary.\\n\\nOnce the script is complete, you can then input the model positives \\ninto the prioritization code and replace the old absence lines on\\nArcGIS Online.\\n\""

    "Inputs required, stored in one geodatabase at the same projection:\n",

    "\n",
    "How to Use:\n",
    "If you are running this for the first model output file from 2022, no code needs \n",
